Todo - Protocol.

Step 1 : Flooding the packats around the phantom nodes.[Done]

Step 2 : Implement the attacker model.[Done]

Step 3 : Accomplished a task, Celebrate!. [Done]

Step 4 : Flooding concept.

        Do changes in get_square() and get_square2() module! for flooding the packets!.
        Where all the nodes inside the phantom square and including the phantom square's 
        node's power will be reducted 2 times!.

Step 5 : Attacker model.

        Attacker model keeps tracks of the node which sents packet to it and the attacker clone it's position as well.
        
        i) (iter->x == attacker_x && iter->y == attacker_y) attacker_x = source_x,attacker_y = source_y;
        ii) create a condition in all transaction of packages.
                1)if condition is true,let the transaction does and so on, if false, then the package should be cancelled
                and move on to the next package.
